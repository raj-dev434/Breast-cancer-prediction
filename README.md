This project is a Machine Learning-based Breast Cancer Diagnosis App built with Streamlit. It allows users to predict whether a tumor is Benign (0) or Malignant (1) using five different ML algorithms.
supoorts five algorithm such that 
      logistic regression
      K-nearest neighbor
      Support vector Machine
      Random forest
      C4.5 (decision tree)

it takes input in both manual and csv format
it display the result radar chart and additionally we can switch model algorithm
